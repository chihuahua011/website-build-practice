EasyBank task from Frontend Mentor.

I'm creating it with React js and purely with styled components. For some reason I find styled-components much better
than using css, at least I don't have to jump back and forth between files to edit them. I don't know if it's a "best practice"
or not but if nothing else it's a good practice.
